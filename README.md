First Project

#a) I've choosen Ruby on Railas as my server framework as it it new and evolving. Ruby has many funtionalities given by its gems. It also has a good configuration with heroku.

#b) I have choose AngularJS as it is widespread. Great open source communities and I found more tutorials on AngularJS which got me started on it.

#c) I found it easy to implement my code on rails server and heroku. Heroku has a straighforward steps or setting up and deploying

#d) I foung it hard setting up databse and some specific gems for rails and heroku. I consumed much of my time. Ex. sqlite didn't work on heroku.

#e) I have installed a sublime text editor to manage my .html, .json files. They give syntax specific colours which makes code easy to look at.

	$ cd app1

	$ git commit -am "Comment"

	$ git push heroku master
At last run my server by
	$ heroku open
